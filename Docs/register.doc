Sinclair ZX Spectrum Emulator 'Z80' v4.00  -  6/3/99  -  by G.A. Lunter



    'Z80' is a shareware program.  The program is not completely
    functional, and the parts which are left out are included when you
    register.  You are encouraged to give this demo version to friends, but
    DO NOT change the original archive in any way, please.  The shareware
    version of the emulator consists of the Z80-400.ZIP archive file, which
    should contain the following 3 files:

        INSTALL.EXE  - installation program
        INSTALL.000  - installation data file
        README.TXT   - short description of the program

    The shareware version includes WinZ80, the Windows version of Z80,
    The registered versions of Z80 and WinZ80 feature the following extras:

    Z80:

	* Full DISCiPLE disk interface emulation
	* Direct loading of tapes via SoundBlaster or LPT-interface
	* No time restrictions, adjustable emulation speed at all times

    WinZ80:

        * Direct loading of tapes through any Windows wave input device
          (e.g. SoundBlaster)
        * No time restrictions, no intro window.

    If you register, you get the fully working versions, and the following
    utilities:


        CONVERT  - a general conversion program: can list out BASIC and
                   translate it back, produce .GIF or .PCX files from
                   screen dumps, translate Spectrum ASCII (CR) to PC ASCII
                   (CR/LF), and some other things.
        CONVZ80  - Translates various snapshot and tape formats of other
                   Spectrum emulators into each other.  Can handle the
                   familiar .SNA format use by several emulators (JPP,
                   XZX,...), and also Pedro Gimeno's (VGASPEC and SPECTRUM)
                   .SP format and Kevin J. Phairs' (SPECEM) .PRG format.
                   It can also handle tape files of SPECEM and L. Rindt and
                   E. Brukner's emulator ZX.
        DISCIPLE - Reads DISCiPLE and Plus D diskettes, both 3.5'' and
                   5.25''.  It translates the 48K and 128K snapshot files
                   to .Z80 snapshots, and ordinary files and screen
                   snapshots to .TAP tape files. (Not necessary for the
                   fully registered version, but handy for the cheaper
                   one.)
        ADDDAT   - Utility to edit the additional data part of .SLT
                   snapshot files, which contain loading screens and level
                   data.
        Z802TAP  - Converts a .Z80 snapshot, 48K or 128K, to a .TAP file
                   which can be loaded into the emulator and saved to tape
                   by the next utility:
        TAP2TAPE - Saves the contents of a .TAP file back to tape, to load
                   it into an ordinary Spectrum.
        TAP2VOC  - Converts a .TAP file to a .VOC sound sample file, to
                   write to tape, or to load into the emulator.
        READVOC  - Reads in a long, 'digital' .VOC sound sample, to be used
                   as input to the emulator, from the LPT tape interface or
                   a SoundBlaster.
        READSB   - Reads .VOC sound samples from SoundBlaster using DMA,
                   and applies a digital filtering and oversampling algo-
                   rithm tuned for Spectrum tapes.
        OUT2VOC  - Converts .OUT log files into .VOC or raw sound sample
                   files, so that you can easily extract music samples from
                   Spectrum/Spectrum 128 games, or SAVE directly to a .VOC
                   or raw sample file.
        Z80DUMP  - Shows the header and the contents of a .Z80 file.


    You will also receive the source files of both emulators, the above
    utilities and the SamRam.  You will also be kept informed about future
    (major) updates.



    How to register:
    ================


    You can register either Z80 (the DOS program), or WinZ80, or both.
    Registration of Z80 or WinZ80 is BP 15; registration of both programs
    at once is BP 20.  If you register just one program, please indicate
    clearly whether you want Z80 or WinZ80.  If you specify neither, we
    will assume you want the DOS program.

    For those who sent their registration fee upon reading the information
    that comes with the now obsolete version 3.05, note that Z80 v4.00
    emulates the DISCiPLE in all cases; if you sent the BP 20 fee you will
    receive both Z80 with DISCiPLE emulation and WinZ80.

    Please send the money in cash in British currency, or as a cheque made
    payable to Chezron Software, to:

                Chezron Software

    If this is inconvenient, you can also send US$ 20 / US$ 25, or DM 35 /
    DM 50 in cash.  Please do NOT send cheques in currencies other than
    British Pounds.



    If you are living in the Czech Republic:
    ========================================


    Then it is probably more convenient to register with JIMAZ.  Also from
    neighbouring countries it may be quicker and/or cheaper to register
    with them.  The address is:

                JIMAZ s.r.o.
                Hermanova 37
                170 00 Praha 7
                Czech Republic
                Phone:  +42 2 379 498
                Fax:    +42 2 378 103
                Email:  jimaz@jimaz.cz

    The registration fee is Cz 500 for either program, Cz 650 for both.



    Are you a registered user already?
    ==================================

    In that case you can obtain Z80 version 4.00 with DISCiPLE emulation,
    the full WinZ80 package, and all utilities and sources, by sending BP
    10 (US$ 15, DM 25) to Chezron Software or Jimaz (see the addresses
    above).  Please clearly indicate the following:

           * That you apply for an update,
           * Your name,
           * Your current address and home country,
           * If different, the address under which you registered, or last
             updated, your version of Z80,
           * The version of Z80 you own (e.g. 3.05 or 2.01 or ...), and
             whether it emulates the DISCiPLE




    All sites reserve the right to ignore any order which does not comply
    with the conditions above.



    The tape interface
    ==================

    The interface described by the circuit diagram in DIAGRAM.Z80 provides
    a reliable means for loading any Spectrum program into Z80.  If you
    don't want to make this interface yourself, a ready built one can be
    obtained through B G Services, for BP 14.50.  These are professional
    quality items built into 25W 'D' connectors.  The address is:
